You should add your zones to: named.conf.local
Generally, that's the only file you will need to modify

configs,data are not part of this repo. They are hosted in a more secure repo

#Install and setup 

Git clone this repo and the config repo.  Your config directory should contain your name.conf file and zone data 
docker run --name=dns-master -d \
--dns=8.8.8.8 --dns=8.8.4.4 \
-p 53:53/udp -p 53:53/tcp \
test:bind

If you plan on using swarm , make sure the image is built on each node. We are not using a repository at the moment. 
Docker swarm to avoid the need for a secondary dns server. only serve the masters via the swarm 
docker swarm init 
docker service create --name=dns-master --replicas 2 --dns=8.8.8.8 --dns=8.8.4.4 -p 53:53/udp -p 53:53/tcp test:bind
